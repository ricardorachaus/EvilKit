# EvilKit

### Current status - SpriteNode and Rect ShapeNode with proportions.

A reimplemation of Apple's SpriteKit for personal purposes of study of Metal and Game Engine development.
In any way this is supose to replace SpriteKit, since Apple's framework has probably much better code and optimizations.

Also, this version of SpriteKit it's not a exactly copy. I will try my best to be identical to SpriteKit interface, but a lot of the framework functionality was never used be me and the people I know, so first I will recreate the core functions (or which I think it is) and perphaps in the future, I finish with all SpriteKit functionality.

All Metal related code is based in [2etime Metal tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXt1-oJUa4BVgjZt9tK2MhV_DW7PVDsg).
